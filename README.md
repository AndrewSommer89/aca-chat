# Windows users - Make sure you remove single quotes from the package.json

# Setup
* Look at server/index.js and understand what is going on in there



# Todo
* Do yarn start 
* This will start a web server and my custom data server (server/index.js)
* I will open 2 browsers windows to http://myipaddress:3101/
* If I send a message from one window and then refresh the other window the message shows up
* You try this by going to http://myipaddress:3101/
* Look at the console, there is an error. Why? Look at actions/index.js
* I do not want to have to refresh the page every time I want to see new messages. I want the new messages to just show up automatically. How can we accomplish this.
